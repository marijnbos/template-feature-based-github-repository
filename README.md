# Template Repo

## Overview

The Template Repo is designed to streamline the process of setting up a new GitHub repository for collaborative projects. Its primary goal is to simplify the initial project setup, making it easier for developers to begin working together efficiently.

## Features

### Easy Project Initialization

Setting up a new GitHub repository can often be a cumbersome and repetitive task. The Template Repo simplifies this process by providing a standardized structure that you can use as a starting point for various types of projects.

### Customization

While the Template Repo provides a standardized structure, it's also highly customizable. Tailor it to your project's specific needs by adding or removing files, adjusting the folder structure, and defining project-specific guidelines.

### Continuous Integration

This template repo does not have any pre-defined GitHub actions to ensure that it's compatible with all projects.

### Documentation

This repo has 3 main features:
* protected main branch: 
* Stale issues, pull request action
* Welcome message action, to greet new users

I mainly use it to get a head start on new projects, my own coding solutions often use the same boilerplate principles. This helps me get a headstart.
